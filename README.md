# Seasonal Pickings!

"Seasonal Pickings" is a web-application that aims to promote healthy eating habits and the use of locally-sourced food. Locally-sourced food supports local farmers, reduces carbon footprint, and provides more nutritious options for consumers. The app includes a game that challenges children to identify and locate seasonal produce for recipes, with real recipes provided for parents to use. It also showcases local sellers of locally sourced food, making it easier for families to make sustainable decisions. We believe the app has the potential to make a difference in promoting healthy eating habits and supporting local businesses

This is a screenshot from our web-application showing a selection of seasonal recipes which can be sourced locally. The web-app also can show you the steps and a full list of ingredients to make a selection of seasonal recipes. These recipes can also be reviewed on the web-app and you can see other peoples' ratings and reviews of dishes that you are wanting to try!
